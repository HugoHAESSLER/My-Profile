			<h2>Business</h2>
				<p>Business is what cadences our everyday life. The field is broad in a way that it has an influence on almost all aspect of societies, but also on nature and people. From sales to human resources, it expresses itself through creativity, adaptability, soft skills and even sometimes politics. Even though some people may say that they aren't intersted, this subject will always be used even unawarely to take decisions. I like to study the dynamics but also the effects that a single decision could have on an entire economy. This is a field in which I am currently specializing myself.</p>

			<h2>Travels and cultures </h2>
				<p>Travels and cultures are my main passion, I love to visit other exotic countries where I don't speak the language and I don't know the culture. This way I get to be plunged in it and to live it by interacting with people, but also by learning their customs and tasting their food. Another passion that can be linked to it is hotelry and aeronautical fields. When I travel, I recognise that depending on the the transport mean or the way one sleeps is having an influence on the well being of the visit.</p>

			<h2>Automobile industry</h2>
				<p>The automobile industry is a field in which I am very interested. In fact, firstly, my passion is cars, their designs, their specificities as well as their performances. A beautiful car is always enjoyable to watch and even though they respond under the same name, they are all different. Aside from that The automobile industry is one of the fastest developing one in the world. In fact, nowadays vehicules are one of the planet's largest CO2 emitters. I am passionate about following how companies operate key changes in their strategies as well as in their technologies in order to ensure a stable future. </p>
